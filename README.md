# Seasons Greetings Card 2021
This is a Season's Greetings card that I found off the internet. Thank you to Computing 101 for this program! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

Note: put the `shapes.py` file into your Python's "Lib" folder as this is a module that is required to run the Python program. Then run `python3 main_card_code.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.
