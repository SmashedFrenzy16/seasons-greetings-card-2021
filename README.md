# Seasons Greetings Card 2021
This is a Season's Greetings card that I found off the internet. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

Note: put the `shapes.py` file into your Lib folder as this is a module that is required to run the Python program. Then run `python3 main.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.
